# Tartarus Deep

A **research only** deep learning implementation for JavaScript.

Not intended for production use.


Provides from the ground up implementation for:

* Matrix operations
* Back and forward propagation
* Logistic regression
* Gradient descent
* Loss algorithms
* Neural networks
* CNNs
* RNNs

Decidedly unoptimized -- written for convenience, not speed.
