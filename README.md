# Tartarus Deep

A **research only** deep learning implementation for TypeScript.

Not intended for production use.

Platform goals:
* Runs on Node.js
* Runs on modern browsers


Provides from-the-ground-up implementation for:

* Vector operations
* Matrix operations
* Back and forward propagation
* Logistic regression
* Gradient descent
* Loss functions
* Activation functions
* Neural networks
* CNNs
* RNNs
* Regularization

Decidedly unoptimized -- written for convenience, not for speed.
